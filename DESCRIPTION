Title: Non-Longitudinal Bayesian Historical Borrowing Models
Description: Historical borrowing in clinical trials can improve
  precision and operating characteristics. This package supports
  a hierarchical model and a mixture model to borrow historical
  control data from other studies to better characterize the
  control response of the current study. It also quantifies
  the amount of borrowing through benchmark models (independent
  and pooled). Some of the methods are discussed by
  Viele et al. (2013) <doi:10.1002/pst.1589>.
